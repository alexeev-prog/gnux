# GNUX Documentation
GNUX is a set of updated GNU Core Utils and other basic Linux utilities. The main goal is to make utilities more convenient and smarter to use.

The GNUX architecture is divided into C extensions and python code. Python code is a wrapper for C code, a front end. It is also possible that some minor functionality will be implemented in the python part.
